- dotfiles
    These are my personal dotfiles:
        ● RAW.
        ● Don't expect them to work right.
        ● Free to steal, copy, redistribute and use.

    I use them on two seperate machines as of right now. There is some
    `hostname'(1) dependent code inside. Use with `stow' — the software
    package installation manager; e.g. to install vim files:

        % stow -t ~ vim
        % l -l ~/.config/nvim
        lrwxrwxrwx 1 s s 41 Sep 19 16:41 ~/.config/nvim -> ../code/desktop/dotfiles/vim/.config/nvim

    Amongs the things I use are vim, zsh, xbindkeys, git, tmux. Vim's
    plugins can be installed with :PlugInstall.

- cron
    0 13 * * * ruby -e 'require "date"; n = Time.now; exit (6 + n.wday + n.to_date.cweek).modulo(7) == 0' && (cd ~/code/desktop/dotfiles; ~/bin/dev/auto-commit .; git push)
