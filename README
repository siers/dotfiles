- dotfiles
    These are my personal dotfiles:
        ● RAW.
        ● Don't expect them to work right.
        ● Free to steal, copy, redistribute and use.

    I use them on two seperate machines as of right now. There is some
    `hostname'(1) dependent code inside. Use with `stow' — the software
    package installation manager.

    Amongs the things I use are vim, zsh, xbindkeys, git, tmux.

    The vimconfig is a little messy — so, I included only vimrc. I'll fix it
    one day and include it here.
